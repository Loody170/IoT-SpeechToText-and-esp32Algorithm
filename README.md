# IoT-SpeechToText-and-esp32Algorithm
This repository contains the deliverables for week 2 task 1 for smart methods summer training.

This project has two parts, the first part is a web app that is a speech to text converter, using JavaScript and HTML.
for running the web app, please make sure that the html file and the script.js file are put together, also please make sure to choose the language you want to convert before starting, if nothing is chosen, it will use your default system language. the application supports both English and Arabic languages.

As mentioned above, the app has two files. first, I did the html code to design the website and put a text box for the text to appear and a button to start recording, then I linked this html code to a JavaScript code to make it function.
this JavaScript code uses the web API speech to text recognition library. I used some of its functions for this app.

As for part 2, here is the necessary algorithm to start and run the Wasdom esp32 hardware
